# Distributed parallel searching or training in two or more nodes:
# 1. Distributed parallel search in the NAS and HPO phases. 
# 2. Distributed parallel training of multiple models in the fullytrain phase.
#
# You need to adjust the general configuration according to the following example.
# The cluster requires NFS support. You need to configure NFS directories that can be accessed by all nodes.


#### copy the following configuration to your yaml file ####
general:
    task:
        local_base_path: "/home/<home dir>/nfs_folder/"    # root path of the task, which must be an NFS path
    backend: pytorch   # pytorch, tensorflow or mindspore  
    parallel_search: True
    parallel_fully_train: True
    cluster:
        master_ip: 192.168.0.2  # IP address of the node where the Vega is started.
        listen_port: 8786
        slaves: [192.168.0.3]   # or [192.168.0.3, 192.168.0.4, 192.168.0.5], according to cluster information
